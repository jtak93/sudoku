## ABOUT
This is a sudoku game made to practice react. Inspired by a codewars challenge that I solved.

# Local Install
Clone and enter repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/jtak93/sudoku.git [YourRepoName]
cd [YourRepoName]
```

I recommend using yarn.

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn start
```

## IN PROGRESS
app is still in progress, but I am periodically deploying it:
```
http://aws-website-sudoku-nv53y.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

### TODO:
-Differentiate between user input and immutable problem set
-Styling
-Add Prop Type validations
-Add redux architecture with server back end to make data persist and more manageable.
-import solution checker/button (function that i made in codewars)

Way down the line:
-add random puzzle generator
