## ABOUT
This is a sudoku game made to practice react. Inspired by a codewars challenge that I solved.

### TODO:
-Styling
-Add Prop Type validations
-Add input of answers/click functionality (really need to think about UX)
-Add redux architecture with server back end to make data persist and more manageable.
-import solution checker/button (function that i made in codewars)

Way down the line:
-add random puzzle generator
